### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I struggle  to understand how to use CSS to style webpages. This challenge has enabled to test my CSS skills so far and understand how to interpret what I am coding adn see it reflect on the page. 
I am feeling more confident in this challenge  as it allowed me to practice using CSS together with advancing my HTML skills.

### Continued development

I would like to enhance this project in the future and make it more interactive. The user can be able to use the switch to the back of the QR code. I would also like to improve CSS styling by adding animations.
